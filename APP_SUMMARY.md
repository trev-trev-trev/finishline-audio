# FLAAS — App Summary (8 Sentences)

**FLAAS (Finishline Audio Automated System)** is an autonomous audio mastering system that controls Ableton Live over the network via OSC (Open Sound Control) to produce streaming-ready or loud-preview stereo masters in roughly 30 minutes from a single command. It assumes a fixed master chain in Ableton: Utility → EQ Eight → Waves C6 (multiband) → Waves F6 (static) → Waves SSL Compressor → Saturator → Waves L3 UltraMaximizer, and iteratively adjusts C6, SSL, Saturator, and L3 parameters (thresholds, makeup, drive, limiter ceiling) by sending normalized parameter values to Ableton’s API, then triggering a bounce. On macOS it drives Ableton’s Export dialog via AppleScript (Accessibility + Automation permissions), waits for the exported WAV to appear, and optionally runs pre-flight checks (master fader at 0 dB, device order) before each run. The loop is: set parameters → trigger export → read the resulting WAV → measure integrated LUFS and true peak (using pyloudnorm and a 4× oversampled peak approximation) → compare to the chosen mode target (streaming_safe −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP, loud_preview −9 LUFS / −1 dBTP, or headroom −10 LUFS / −2 dBTP) → adjust parameters and repeat until the target is met or diminishing returns are detected (e.g. &lt; 0.2 LU improvement), with each iteration logged to a JSONL file (parameters, LUFS, true peak, SHA256). The CLI (`flaas`) exposes subcommands for master-premium (main workflow), verify-audio (analyze a WAV and print LUFS/peak), ping (test AbletonOSC), plus lower-level tools for scanning tracks, setting device parameters, and running experiments. Verification and QC are handled by separate scripts: single-file and batch streaming validators (Spotify/Apple/YouTube/Tidal specs), a QC compare script that reports target alignment, gain-match simulation (projected true peak if normalized to −14 or −9 LUFS), LRA and crest factor, and a health-check script that confirms git, tests, venv, and critical files. The project includes 71 unit tests (analyze, OSC RPC, preflight, targets, util, master_premium), run locally via pytest and automatically every 30 minutes via a macOS launchd job, with documentation covering quick start, cheatsheet, security audit, testing, API, and status/state so the app can be understood and operated end-to-end without guesswork.
