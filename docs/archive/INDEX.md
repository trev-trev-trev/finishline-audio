## Archive vs. Active Docs

- **Archive files** (in `extracted/`): Preserved originals for reference
- **Active files** (moved to proper locations): Living documents updated during development
- **Both preserved**: Git history maintained via `git mv`

## Notes

- Archive contains planning docs from pre-implementation phase
- All files have been reorganized into the structured `docs/` hierarchy
- Original `Archive.zip` remains in repo root for historical reference
- `__MACOSX` metadata folder in extracted/ can be ignored
